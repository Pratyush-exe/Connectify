# Introduction - the project's aim.
It's a friendly and safe social platform where people can meet, interract with each other and can spend some quality time. The messages are filtered before sending. If any message is found offensive, they application blocks it and sends a warning message. People all over the world can access the rooms and enter into any room and begin chatting. When users login through their UserName or Password, their data is authenticated using FireBase and stored safely in cloud. Users can relogin or create new accounts. Users can video chat, watch synced youtube videos, play skribbl or smashKarts with "room-mates" online.
